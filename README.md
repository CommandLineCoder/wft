whats-for-tea a program to help manage food and recipies. 


This program is a hack job to get something i can start to use to record recipies and food data. 

The goal is to have a series of recipies that are cheap, tasty and simple to cook and have them
calorie counted so a balanced diet can be created.

Intiial version of the program is in C, however plans are to make future versions in Java
